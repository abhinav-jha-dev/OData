# OData-Boilerplate
> POC for implementing OData with Asp.Net Core 2.1 webapi.

[![Build Status][travis-image]][travis-url]

Originally developed by Microsoft in 2007, [OData][OData-Url] is an OASIS standard REST API and is established among companies such as Microsoft, SAP, CA, IBM and Salesforce. It allows the creation and consumption of queryable and interoperable RESTful APIs in a simple and standard way. OData gives you a rich set of querying capabilities and is quickly gaining ground for its open source approach, as well as its exceptional scalability.

If you want to find the difference between OData, GraphQL and ORDS please have a look to this [article][Odata-comparison].

To read more on my findings please have a look on my [GitPad][OData-Gitpad]
